# tripluno
*what is tripulpi*

pi is a currency hosted on a network of raspberry pis with USB mass storage devices, your wallet gets hosted onto three nodes, all of them keep track of eachother and every time it does the operators get a bit of tripulpi

*what about the network*

the network will be given out to diffrent node operators who will get a massive amount of tripulpi for keeping the network alive
three networks may be a valid idea

Plans for tripulpi

-1 wallet hosted on 3 nodes
-each pi will be able to hold thousands of wallets
-each node will be a raspberry pi with a USB stick (home computers not recommended as the server may or may not get attacked
-USB mass drive must have tons of space to deal with spam
-server gets passed to different nodes
-nodes that win the server get a reward
-nodes get a reward every time it scans for changes
-if all 3 nodes go offline the wallet gets bounced to the server and gets sent to new hosts
-server will be self hosted until it gets popularity
-server will be developed locally
-if one node wallet amount is different from the other two the two arduinos will request it to be changed back
-every time all three arduinos are changed the server will verify the transactions
-no fees for a while
